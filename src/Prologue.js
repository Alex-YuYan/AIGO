                One day, you wake up to find that AIGO has updated its terms of use. It now requires all your personal data, for the purpose of providing more accurate recommendations. On the basis of the basic personal information you have granted it before, it now includes your financial information, healthcare record, and even access to the surveillance cameras at your workplace and home, which you installed to prevent theft.
                </p>
                <p>
                At first, you are shocked, but soon realize that the benefits of AIGO can very easily outweigh the risks associated with giving up your personal data. With its help, you can now shop, find entertainment, and even manage your finances with super ease. All in all, you are just a normal person, what is AIGO to steal from you?
                </p>
                <p>
                However, you still retain some worry about the implications of giving up your personal data. You worry about who will have access to it, and what they might do with it. And even if AIGO reassures you nearly every single minute that your personal data will not be misused, you still feel that you are somewhat becoming a “transparent” person. 
                </p>
                <p>
                But now, the choice lies in front of you. Either you choose to accept the terms and continue to enjoy the benefits of a super smart recommendation system, or you lose access to it, and who knows what the cost of re-subscribing to AIGO will be?
