                You find yourself in a mess without the recommendation algorithm. When facing some unexpected events, you do not make the best decision. You continue to fight against the unequal terms of use in AIGO. This morning, you plan to work from home.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve your productivity, you decide to start your day with an ice Americano. You are used to working with your laptop and monitors. The split-screen feature of the monitor can give you great convenience and improve your work efficiency, and luckily this doesnâ€™t require AIGO to function.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the worst is yet to come. Your coffee mug is accidentally knocked over. Fortunately, the spilled coffee only affected the monitor charger instead of your computer. You hastily unplug the monitor. Upon inspection, you find that the charger for your monitor has been damaged. You have to buy a new charging device on Amazon. However, without the help of AIGO's recommendation algorithm, you have to search for the device charger you need (your monitor was bought a long time ago, and you can't quite remember its type). After searching for a long time, you believe you have chosen the right charger type. You want this charging cable delivered to your home quickly. With the use of a monitor, you can speed up your productivity a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, as the new charger arrives, you discover that you have chosen the wrong model. You have to go to an offline store to determine the correct model and buy a new charger. This time, you finally get the charger you needed. But you have wasted too much time on something AIGO can do in seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                This incident makes you think again about whether to stop resisting and use AIGO again. But you have not forgotten AIGO's reminder that as days pass without using AIGO, the price tag of rejoining AIGO becomes higher day by day.
